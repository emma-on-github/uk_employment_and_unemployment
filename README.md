Hello,

I am new to programming and are putting the theory into practice.

Within this simple programme I created a Matplotlib Line chart displaying UK Employment and Unemployment Rates between February 1971 to May 2023.

I have included a Microsoft Excel file with the data.  The original data sets can be found at:

Thank you.
